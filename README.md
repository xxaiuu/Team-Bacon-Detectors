# Final Project Code For ECE118 
### Group 2: Samuel Indurkar, Tony Chen and Alexandria Liu 

Aspects of the final project:

- navigate to a triangular tower (which radiates a 2khz frequency) while ignoring other noise frequency (1.5khz and 2.5khz)


      - this is done by a beacon detector
      
- do not fall off the playfield table
      - near the edges of the table have black tape
      - using a table sensor, we will know when we will be on black tape

- there will be a cross made out of black tape on the middle of the field
      - we are allow to cross it

- dead bots on the field
      - completely black, shorter than the tower

- once at the tower, only one side will be the correct side, as indicated by a 24-25khz signal
      - using a track wire circuit, it can detect which is the correct side
      - the correct hole to launch the ping pong ball through will be indicated by a black stripe of tape
      - must accurately launch or place ping pong ball into the correct hole (shoot only once)

- go and find other towers on the field (there are a total of 3 triangular towers on the playing field)

- must complete the challenge within 2 minutes
